The point is to offer a user or a group of users access to some entities, without breaking the logical flow
of problems/solutions hierarchy.

For any entity the creator can specify a privacy level
- private 
- privately shared ( can only bee seen by the members of the group )
- publicly shared ( can be seen by anyone but cannot be acted upon )
- same as parent


Create table privacy_levels

-level 
0 - private
1 - privately shared
2 - publicly shared
null - will be considered public

-level_name


Create table privacy_rules

-privacy_rule_id
-privacy_level_id
-sharing_group_id ( will be null if the privacy level does not refer to a shared type access level )


The column "privacy_rule_id" will be created in the "entities" table to hold a reference to the privacy rule set for
that entity

Modify the add/update entity flows to allow the setting of privacy rule for an entity

Add a new combobox to the input form from where the user can select the privacy rule for the entity
By default "same as parent" will be selected and in this case the privacy rule of the current parent will be
set also for current entity

Modify the "open entity" flow to check if the user has access to the requested entity ( should be done in the middleware )

Modify the  "list subentities" flow in order to filter out the entities to which the user does not have access
