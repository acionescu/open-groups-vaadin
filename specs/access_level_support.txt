The point is to offer a user or a group of users access to some entities, without breaking the logical flow
of problems/solutions hierarchy.

The access rules will define the access to a certain entity of different types of users.

There will be three types of users:
-the creator which will have total access to the entity
-the member of a group with which the entity is shared
-the others

Each access rule will define permission for group members and the others

Permissions will define to what type of actions a users will have access to

Create table access_permissions
-id
-name

Create table action_types_permissions
-permission_id
-action_type_id


Create table access_rules

-id
-name
-group_permissions_id
-others_permissions_id
-active


Values for access_level:
 
0 - private
1 - privately shared
2 - publicly shared


The column "access_rule_id" will be created in the "entities" table to hold a reference to the access rule set for
that entity
null - will be considered public

Add column "group_id" to the entities table in order to store the group with which the entity is shared

Modify the add/update entity flows to allow the setting of privacy rule for an entity

Add a new combobox to the input form from where the user can select the privacy rule for the entity
By default "same as parent" will be selected and in this case the privacy rule of the current parent will be
set also for current entity

Modify the "open entity" flow to check if the user has access to the requested entity ( should be done in the middleware )

Modify the  "list subentities" flow in order to filter out the entities to which the user does not have access
