The point is to offer a user or a group of users access to some entities, without breaking the logical flow
of problems/solutions hierarchy.

A group is a collection of:
-users
-problems
-resources
- possibly actions and events


A user can be a member of multiple groups

A user can become member of a group in two ways: Either creates a group or accepts an invitation to join a certain group from
a member of that group

Levels of privacy:

private -> the entity is invisible to anyone who does not have access
readonly -> the entity is visible to the specified groups but cannot be modified ( in the sense that nobody can add anything 
under this entity )

Any principal entity ( group/problem ) can accept privacy settings.

How can privacy settings be applied?

To apply privacy settings to an entity, you need to use a combination of a privacy level and target groups.

Each entity establishes the privacy settings of the entities beneath it unless they have their own privacy settings

Important: The privacy settings are not applied on the entity but on the link between the parent and the entity!

The creator of an entity can mark it as private or readonly. The information will be correlated with 
the current entity_link_id

However the privacy of an entity cannot be less restrictive then the privacies of its ancestors

To share an entity that you created with people from other groups, you can create a reference to the entity under the desired
groups, with entirely new privacy settings
